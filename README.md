# Bird Trading Platform - Front End

The bird trading platform is a web application that allows users to search, buy, sell birds and food or accessories related to birds. It is designed for bird enthusiasts, breeders, and sellers who want a convenient platform to conduct transactions. The user interface design is created using Figma. The front-end of the platform is built using modern web development technologies such as ReactJS and SCSS. To handle user interactions, JavaScript is used along with Redux Toolkit, which provides efficient state management. Socket IO is used to create a real-time chatbox feature, enabling users to communicate with one another within the platform. The Material UI React component library is utilized to make the UI components consistent, easy to use, and accessible.

Overall, the bird trading platform provides a seamless user experience for buying, selling, and trading birds, making it an ideal solution for anyone interested in bird-related transactions.
